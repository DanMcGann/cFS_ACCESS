** File Name:  comm_ft.h
**
** Title:  Type Header File for COMM Application file Transfer Functions
**
** $Author:    Daniel McGann
** $Revision: 1.1 $
** $Date:      2018-05-14
**
** Purpose:  This header file contains declarations for a set of functions that allow
** COMM to transfer files through commonly used file transfer applications. These
** functions can be used for the COMM Configuration SEND_FILE_FUNC parameter.
**
** NOTES:
** If the mission is using a file transport application not supported "out of the box"
** mission specific functions can be declared in this file, and written in the
** the corresponding source file. OR the source code for the files can be included in
** comm/fsw/platform_cfg/comm_platform_cfg.h file.
**
**
** Send file - Transmits a file to the linked target
**
** All SEND_FILE_FUNC Functions should have the signature
**
** int32 <func_name>(char File[OS_MAX_PATH_LEN]
**
** and should return  CFE_SUCCESS [0] on a successful operation and anything else to
** represent an error.
**
**
** ** All SEND_FILE_FUNC Functions should have the signature
**
** int32 <func_name>(char File[OS_MAX_PATH_LEN]
**
** and should return  CFE_SUCCESS [0] on a successful operation and anything else to
** represent an error.
**
**
**
** StopLink - Stops the transmission of any files currently being processed
** 	by the configurable file transfer application.
**
** ALL STOP_LINK_FUNC Functions should have the signature
**
** int32 <func_name>(void)
**
** and should return CFE_SUCCESS if the operation is successful and anything esle to
** represent an error
