** Name: SEM_ReqPlan
**
** \brief Requests a new plan from the satellite's planning layer.
**
** \par Description:
** 		Sends request to the Satellite's planning layer asking to be sent a new plan
** 		of actions.
**
** 		This can be prompted nominally, by a plan ending, or scheduled replan. However,
** 		will also be triggered if a non-critical error occurs that causes the failure
** 		of some scheduled action.
**
=====================================================================================*/
void SEM_ReqPlan(void);

/*=====================================================================================
** Name: SEM_CheckPrereqs()
**
** \brief Validates key state telemetry required for initiation of the given action
**
** \par Description:
** 		Using the Currently available satellite state information, and the configured
** 		action prerequisite list, checks to ensure the current satellite is within safe
** 		parameters to begin execution of the given action.
**
**	\param [in] ActionId_t	- The action of which to check the prerequisites.
**

boolean SEM_CheckPrereqs(SEM_ActionId_t id);

/*=====================================================================================
** Name: SEM_InitAction()
**
** \brief Begins execution of the given action.
**
** \par Description:
** 		Initiates the execution of the specified action, by sending either the action's
** 		initiation command, or instructing SC to begin the configured RTS.
**
** 	\par Notes, and Assumptions
** 		Actions should only be initiated under the circumstance that all of their
** 		Prerequisite checks successfully pass.
**
**	\param [in] ActionId_t	- The action of which to initiate.
**
**	\returns
**		\retstmt CFE_SUCCESS - The the initialization of the action is successful
**		\retstmt SEM_INVALID_ACTION_ERR_EID - If the initiation of the action fails
**  \endreturns

** Name: SEM_StartSchedule
**
** \brief Starts execution of the current schedule
**
** \par Description:
** 		Starts the execution of the current plan. On start skips all actions listed
** 		that were scheduled to be initiated in the past. Can be used to restart a
** 		previously halted plan, but will skip any actions that were schedules to
** 		execute while the schedule was not being executed.
**
** \par Developer Notes:
** 		If you are developing a planning algorithm for use on the access framework
** 		planner should allow for time in between the completion of the planning process
** 		the first action to execute so the ACCESS Framework has time to accept,
** 		translate, schedule, and begin execution of that plan. The exact time is
** 		not provided, as it will depend on the length and format of the plan, as well
** 		as the processor which is running this software.
**

/*=====================================================================================
** Name: SEM_HaltSchedule
**
** \brief Stops execution of the current schedule
**
** \par Description:
** 		Stops the execution of the current schedule. Additionally, this function
** 		if the halt was caused by some critical error. If there is not a critical
** 		error on request will initiate a replan for the satellite from the
** 		satellite's Planning Layer to replace the now compromised plan
**
** \param   uint8 AttemptReplan - Indicates that a new plan should be requested if
**    			execution of the current schedule did not result from a critical error.

void SEM_HaltSchedule(void);

/*=====================================================================================
** Name: SEM_ProcessSchedule
**
** 	\brief Initiates actions set to begin execution in this second
**
**	\par Description:
**		Main handler of the execution of the current schedule. Provides robust
**		mechanism to initiate each scheduled command. This function is
**		run on every wake up of the SEM application (1 Hz).
