**
** 	\brief	This commands sets SEM's mode.
**
**	\par Description: Sets SEM mode of operation to autonomous mode. A user data
**	value of TRUE sets SEM to autonomous mode, and a user data value of FALSE, sets SEM
**	to Non-Autonomous Mode.

** Name: SEM_SchPlanCmd
**
** 	\brief Handles the reception of a new plan from the APL
**
**	\par Description: This function coordinates the reception, translation and
**	start of a satellite schedule of actions, based on a plan recieved from the
**	satellite's Autonomy Planning Layer (APL).
**
**	\Par Notes: A plan should normally only be received and started if no existing
**	schedule is being executed. If a plan is reviewed during the execution of an existing
**	schedule, the function will look for a boolean flag indicating this plan should
**	override any existing plan. If that flag is false, or does not exist the plan
**	will be treated as an error by the APL and thrown away.
